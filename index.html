			<h1> International Sanctions: A Briefer </h1>

			<h2> A rundown on the types of sanctions and how the U.S. Government has employed them in recent years </h2>

		<div class="intro">

			<p> Sanctions are a relatively new phenomenon, but have quickly become a key “tool” in foreign policy. And perhaps no country employs this tool more than the United States. </p>

			<p> <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/722401"> Sanctions were first used in the 1960’s,</a> when England rallied the international community against Rhodesia to quell the uprisings against its rule. </p>

			<p> The term "sanctions" can be applied to a broad range of actions. The main categories are economic, diplomatic, and sports (details below), but each category econmpasses a wide range of actions. <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-are-economic-sanctions">The United States uses economic santions more than any other country in the world. </a> </p>

			<p> How sanctions are employed also matters. While the U.S. relies heavily on unilateral sanctions (working independently of other countries), it also works in partnership with other countries through multilateral bodies like the United Nations. Multilateral sanctions can exist at the regional level, too, through partnerships like the European Union and the African Union. </p>

			<p> Within the U.S., <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-are-economic-sanctions"> the President and Congress have the power to issue economic sanctions. </a> They are then enforced by federal government agencies like the Department of Treasury and the Department of State, although state and local officials sometimes support sanctions enforcement efforts, particularly when it comes to businesses, for instance. </p>

			<h3> ECONOMIC SANCTIONS </h3>
				
				<p> Changes in trade and financial relations. They can include a broad range of actions, from trade restrictions and freezing assets to a reduction in foreign aid or an arms embargo.  </p>

			<div class="icon-example">

				<p> Arguably the most effective means of holding “bad actors” accountable and can be a useful tool to avoid military confrontation. Also shown to be effective in putting pressure on people/regimes - again, without military confrontation. </p>

			<div class="icon-example">

				<p> If sanctions are overly broad, it can mean consequences for innocent civilians, who are then being held responsible for the actions of their government. It also can be used unilaterally/for political reasons - puts the U.S. in the role of “global enforcer." </p>

			<h3> DIPLOMATIC SANCTIONS </h3>

				<p> Changes in diplomatic presence. Can entail recalling key figures in diplomacy, such as the Ambassador, or other personnel. In some cases a state may even close its embassy.  </p>

			<div class="icon-small"> 

				<img src="outline_add_circle_black_24dp.png" alt="plus sign">

			</div>

			<div class="icon-example">

				<p> Not maintaining diplomatic relations with so-called “bad actors." Not lending to legitimacy to states that may be perpetrating human rights abuses, for instance.</p>

			</div>

					
			<div class="icon-small"> 

				<img src="outline_remove_circle_black_24dp.png" alt="minus sign">

			</div>

			<div class="icon-example">

			<p> Any change in diplomatic relations often means less or a lack of intelligence. </p>

			<h3> SPORTS SANCTIONS </h3>

				<p> Definition: changes in diplomatic presence </p>

				<p> What that means: recalling key figures in diplomacy, such as the Ambassador or other personnel, or even closing an embassy. </p>

			<div class="icon-small"> 

					<img src="outline_add_circle_black_24dp.png" alt="plus sign">

			</div>

			<div class="icon-example">

				<p> Holding states accountable and often embarassing them in an arena that celebrates/promotes national pride/nationalism. Like diplomatic sanctions, sports sanctions are a means of not lending legitimacy to human rights abusers, for instance. </p>

			</div>

			<div class="icon-small"> 

				<img src="outline_remove_circle_black_24dp.png" alt="minus sign">
