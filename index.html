			<h1> International Sanctions: A Briefer </h1>

			<h2> A rundown on the types of sanctions and how the U.S. Government has employed them in recent years </h2>

	</header>

		<div class="intro">

			<p> Sanctions are a relatively new phenomenon, but have quickly become a key “tool” in foreign policy. And perhaps no country employs this tool more than the United States. </p>

			<p> Sanctions were first used in the 1960’s. TIME Magazine reported that England rallied the international community against the "white supremacist" separatist government seeking to separate from England's colonial rule. </p>

			<p> The term "sanctions" can be applied to a broad range of actions. The main categories are economic, diplomatic, and sports (details below), but each category econmpasses a wide range of actions. The United States uses economic santions more than any other country in the world, according to the foreign policy think tank the Council on Foreign Relations. </a> </p>

			<p> How sanctions are employed also matters. While the U.S. relies heavily on unilateral sanctions (working independently of other countries), it also works in partnership with other countries through multilateral bodies like the United Nations. Multilateral sanctions can exist at the regional level, too, through partnerships like the European Union and the African Union. </p>

			<p> Within the U.S., the President and Congress have the power to issue economic sanctions. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, sanctions are then enforced by federal government agencies like the Department of Treasury and the Department of State, although state and local officials sometimes support sanctions enforcement efforts, particularly when it comes to businesses, for instance. </p>

				<h3> ECONOMIC SANCTIONS </h3>

					<p> Changes in trade and financial relations. Economic sanctions encompass a broad range of actions, from trade restrictions and freezing assets to a reduction in foreign aid or an arms embargo.  </p>


				<div class="icon-small"> 

					<img src="outline_add_circle_black_24dp.png" alt="plus sign">

				</div>

				<div class="icon-example">

					<p> Economic sanctions are arguably one of the most effective tools to hold so-called “bad actors” accountable, by putting pressure on people and/or regimes and cutting off their resources, while avoiding military confrontation. </p>

				</div>

				<div class="icon-small"> 

					<img src="outline_remove_circle_black_24dp.png" alt="minus sign">

				</div>

				<div class="icon-example">

					<p> Overly broad economic sanctions mean consequences for innocent civilians, who are then being held responsible for the actions of their government and/or leaders. It's also a politicized process. The U.S. often gets to play the role of “global enforcer," deciding which entities to sanction and often doing so unevenly (i.e. sanctioning some human rights abusers but not others). </p>

				</div>


				<h3> DIPLOMATIC SANCTIONS </h3>

					<p> Changes in diplomatic presence. Diplomatic sanctions can include recalling or expelling key figures in diplomacy, such as the Ambassador. In some extreme a state may even close its embassy.  </p>

				<div class="icon-small"> 

					<img src="outline_add_circle_black_24dp.png" alt="plus sign">

				</div>

				<div class="icon-example">

					<p> While more symbolic than economic sanctions, diplomatic sanctions also are a non-military means of holding so-called “bad actors" accountable. By reducing or cutting off diplomatic ties, a state thus sends a clear message/does not lend legitimacy to states that may be perpetrating human rights abuses, for instance.</p>

				</div>


				<div class="icon-small"> 

					<img src="outline_remove_circle_black_24dp.png" alt="minus sign">

				</div>

				<div class="icon-example">

				<p> The downside is that reducing diplomatic realtions often means less or even no intelligence. This can make it even harder to keep tabs on so-called "bad actors." </p>

				</div>


				<h3> SPORTS SANCTIONS </h3>

					<p> Limiting or banning participation in international sports events, like the Olympics. Sports sanctions can include a partial ban (event-specific participation) or a total ban (no participation in any event). </p>

				<div class="icon-small"> 

						<img src="outline_add_circle_black_24dp.png" alt="plus sign">

				</div>

				<div class="icon-example">

					<p> Sports sanctions are a means of holding states accountable and often embarassing the government in an arena that celebrates and promotes national pride and nationalism. Like diplomatic sanctions, sports sanctions are a means of not lending legitimacy to or condoning human rights abusers, for instance. </p>

				</div>

				<div class="icon-small"> 

					<img src="outline_remove_circle_black_24dp.png" alt="minus sign">

				</div>

				<div class="icon-example">

				<p> Sports sanctions often punish individual athletes for the behavior of their country. Like other sanctions, the standards for "behavior" are often applied inconsistently. </p>

				</div>

			<div class="grid-item-example">

				<p class="example"> EXAMPLE: Cuba. Longstanding U.S. sanctions regime is one of the most comprehensive. Secondary sanctions - U.S. places sanctions on anyone who conducts trade with Cuba. Not a targeted sanctions regime (designed to reduce civilian suffering). </p>

			</div>

			<div class="grid-item-example">

				<p class="example"> EXAMPLE: Russia. Last year, the U.S. expelled several members of the Russian delegation to the U.S. on charges of espionage. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="grid-item-example">

				<p class="example"> EXAMPLE: China. The U.S. State Department said at one point it was considering boycotting the 2022 Olympics in China, as a means of protesting the government's treatment of the Uyghurs. The Uyghurs are an ethnic minority that the U.S. and other countries say are the victims of ethnic cleansing at the hands of the Chinese government. However, the State Department said otherwise. </p>
